# Java SQL Terminal
## COMP-271 (Programming II) [Brookdale Community College]

My classmate and myself were ego tripping after spending an all nighter getting this code to work. 
Lab #21 or Java SQL Terminal draws a JavaFX pane with a command line and two buttons while simultaneously connecting to a local SQL database. 
Through the command line displayed, users can update and modify the database to their likings. Realistically this is very impractical and 
working on databases would be much easier and efficient using an actual database IDE. 
But it's interesting purely for demonstration purposes alone, or at least that's what I think.

The terminal will throw an error if an incorrect command is passed through. Upon the execution of a successful command, the terminal will print 
the modified table. SELECT statements and views will also print normally. The output is still a little messy, I didn't have enough time to really polish it.
